        talk_title: Automate all the things with CI/CD in GitHub Actions
        talk_description: We have many tools to help us build an application consistently with
          high quality from code formatting, through static analysis and
          testing. We can run them locally, but that's too easy to forget, so
          they really come into their own when we run them automatically within
          GitHub, and that's what we'll cover in this talk. I'll show you how to
          set up workflows in GitHub actions to check for all the common and
          not-so-common items that will make it easier to accept changes into
          the project and then follow on from there to show how we can also
          create releases and deploy automatically too. By the end of this
          session you'll be able to create your own workflows that will automate
          the your tooling.

          developers, is the sequel of WordPress through the Terminal talk,
          focusing on a set of commands and tools useful for PHP
          developers.     This is not just a live demo of WP-CLI commands. This
          is zooming out and seeing WP-CLI in collaboration with other tools in
          the context of PHP developer needs and everyday tasks. We’ll probably
          release the Kraken as well.

          onion!     In this humorous talk we'll investigate the structure of
          large monolithic applications and how we can peel back layers to
          reveal greater understanding. Using the principles of hexagonal
          architecture and the science of onion growth, we can make monoliths
          great again.

          need the right tools for detecting and fixing those issues, as well as
          a way to verify that the application is still working correctly. In
          this presentation, I will share the strategy that I employed when
          upgrading millions of lines of untested code.

          time() or new DateTimeImmutable() directly when the information is
          necessary. But that then makes the code a nightmare to test. In this
          session we will see how the new PSR-20 allows us to change that by
          still making it easy to generate current time information but also
          allowing one to test the code. And we will get some background info
          why it was designed in such a way.

        talk_title: Decision-making for developers
        talk_description: What do cars, chess and Peter Griffin have to do with
          decision-making?     Decision-making is a complex process, we go
          through it multiple times per day. Everything from micro-decisions
          like deciding how to write a certain function, up to macro-decisions
          like deciding what framework to use.     As a developer I'm always
          looking for ways to improve myself, and as a lead I'm always looking
          for ways to cultivate an effective and autonomous team. One particular
          skill that is often overlooked is decision-making. In this talk I
          would like to zoom in on this process.     I will be explaining some
          of the psychology that goes into decision-making, give you some
          decision-making techniques, explain how a decision-making framework
          can help your team and why documenting your decisions is essential.

        track: *track_1
        talk_title: "Symfony Messenger: the sharpest tool in your PHP toolbox"
        talk_description: "The PHP ecosystem is very rich and mature, and offers you a lot of
          stable and widely used tools, frameworks and libraries.   Symfony
          evolved long ago from a monolithic framework into a collection of very
          useful and reliable components, but one component in particular (in my
          opinion) really stands out: Symfony Messenger.      In a single
          package, you have an easy way to dispatch messages and tasks to sync
          and async handling, with enough abstraction to support a variety of
          transports natively, and a long list of useful patterns already
          implemented and ready to be used out of the box.     In this talk,
          I'll recount how Symfony Messenger successfully replaced a lot of the
          code that I had to write by hand in the past multiple times, how I
          successfully used it in different situations, all the features and
          tricks that you can leverage with it, why it's important to use them
          and which pitfalls you may encounter using this tool."

          showing off how to deploy secure OCI images on K8S cluster with
          security policies built with Kyverno, the session includes also
          security scanning using the generated SBOM.

          Swoole: a PHP extension that allows you to build high performance

        talk_title: Crafting Elegant APIs with Laravel
        talk_description: Well designed and performant API's are key aspects of good and
          reliable application systems.     Especially when kicking of an API
          system it is really hard to setup and define all boundaries that are
          necessary to build a futureproof API. Changes later on can be time
          consuming and of course expensive.     Therefore it is extremely
          important to plan the API design beforehand and to use best practices
          and patterns from the industry.     In this session I will guide the
          listeners through the creation process of an API with Laravel and will
          introduce and explain all important parts that constitute a battle
          tested and robust API. Things like middleware layers, security tokens
          are only some key points that will be presented on stage.

        talk_description: During this presentation, we are going to look at the new features
          that were introduced in PHP 8.3, and some in earlier
          versions.     Join me to have a look at how the type system is
          strengthened with Typed Class Constants, Readonly Classes, Arbitrary
          Static Variable Initialisers, Overloaded Method Markers, and other new
          smaller features and clean-ups.     At the end you will have a good
          understanding about all the new and exciting features that are part of
          the PHP 8.3 release.

        talk_title: "Community, PHP and us: Growing up"
        talk_description: In year 2000 when PHP 4 just came out, we had functions.php and when
          it started being big we made functions2.php. When object orientation
          came out we renamed our databasefunctions.php and put a class around
          it and called it OOP. PHP by then, was not very mature. I by then, was
          not very mature. The community by then, was not very mature.     We
          have come a long way since then! We now believe 12 year old girls on
          the internet are not FBI agents. We now have type hints, and
          namespaces, and composer! We have all matured.     Let me share my
          story of amazing technology that changed my life. I will also share
          some horrible community experiences, and the awesome ones that kept me
          going.     Let’s keep growing, because we never really stop.

        talk_title: Generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) in PHP
        talk_description: In this talk, I'll give a quick introduction to LLM and how to use in
          a PHP application. I'll show some examples using the LLPhant project
          including a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using OpenAI
          and Elasticsearch as vector database. I'll also present some open
          source LLM like GPT4All.
