    description_long: "This 4-hour workshop will introduce the Large Language Models (LLMs) that have become very popular in this period thanks to the Generative AI momentum.
    <br><br />We will provide the basics of LLMs and how to use it using PHP. In particular, we'll use LLPhant, a comprehensive PHP Generative AI Framework in combination with GPT4 of OpenAI.
    We'll also test some open source LLMs such as Llama 2 using the Ollama project.
    <br><br /><b>The workshop will have a very practical focus: participants will be able to experiment with the examples during the workshop. All you need is a laptop with a PHP 8 runtime.</b><br><br />"
